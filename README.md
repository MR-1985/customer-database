This is a database essecially for using on one PC
Its possible to download the localStorage and save it to a .JSON by downloading.
Upload .JSON is poosible to.
The .JSON can be ubloaded to any PC that has all the code in the storage.
So => when clearing the localStorage, or by using another PC, the .JSON can be uploaded from an USB-Stick or else.
If there is a server in use, it is possible to work by using the URL from the index.html.
Despite a server is used, only the .JSON from the own localStorage can be changed and saved to a .JSON, so other users need the updated.JSON
------------
...coming soon => using this database with automatic storage of the .JSON on an server and a automatic load from this.
..like my other repository named: "license-management"
